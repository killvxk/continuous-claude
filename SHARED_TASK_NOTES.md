# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 7: Opening sentence in "How it works" section
- Reduced from 29 words to 15 words and removed redundancy
- Before: "When you have a task like "Add unit tests until all code is covered", you want to run Claude Code repeatedly until all code is covered. This script does that for you:"
- After: "For tasks that require multiple iterations to complete, this script runs Claude Code repeatedly until done:"

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Line 19: Quick start prerequisites could be clearer
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific
- Line 3: Project description could be more concise
