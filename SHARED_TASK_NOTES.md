# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 7: Opening sentence of "How it works" section
- Before: "This script runs Claude Code in iterations until multi-step tasks are complete:"
- After: "This script automates the entire PR lifecycle—from code changes to merged commits—using Claude Code to drive iterative development:"
- Key change: Highlights the full automation scope (PR lifecycle) rather than just iterations, making the value clearer

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific about what each example demonstrates
- Lines 34-39: Flag descriptions could include more context about when/why to use each option
- Line 15: "A `SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md` file acts as a relay baton..." could be more concise
